# AI_TraceFinder Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
AI_TraceFinder is a forensic scanner identification system that uses machine learning to identify the source scanner device from scanned documents by analyzing unique patterns and artifacts.

## Research Foundation
Based on the research papers downloaded, we have identified key techniques:
- **PRNU Analysis**: Photo-Response Non-Uniformity patterns for device fingerprinting
- **CNN-based Fingerprinting**: Deep learning approaches for scanner identification
- **Texture and Noise Analysis**: Local texture features and scanner-specific noise patterns
- **Machine Learning Classification**: SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks

## Dataset Analysis (SUPATLANTIQUE)
The dataset contains:
- **11 Scanner Models**: Canon (120, 220, 9000), Epson (V39, V370, V550), HP
- **Multiple Resolutions**: 150 DPI and 300 DPI
- **Document Types**: Wikipedia pages, official documents
- **Tampered Images**: Splicing, retouching, copy-move manipulations
- **Flatfield Images**: For calibration and noise analysis
